# Package version pins according to the 《开源生态发展合作倡议》
# ("Open-source Ecosystem Development & Cooperation Initiative") list,
# compiled by 5 Chinese distro vendors: deepin, openAnolis, OpenCloudOS,
# openEuler and openKylin.
#
# Only the most essential packages are included here though; the full list
# in the original initiative is too restrictive, requires huge number of
# backports for LoongArch, and involves package versions that are no longer
# present in ::gentoo. We believe a decent level of compatibility is still
# achievable with this reduced list if proper bundling/avoidance of system
# libraries is done.
