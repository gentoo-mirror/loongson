# Note about LIBDIR_*:
#
# Unlike riscv profiles, LoongArch so far does not define the multilib layout
# for non-multiarch (non-Debian) systems; also the ABIs other than LP64D are
# underdeveloped and likely unusable. So here we only give definitions for
# lp64d.
# Should any official spec be revised such that a multilib layout is defined,
# definitions here should be updated to stay compliant.
