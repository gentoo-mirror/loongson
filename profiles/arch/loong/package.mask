# WANG Xuerui <xen0n@gentoo.org> (2023-08-04)
# Unnecessary since ages: Linux/LoongArch already requires updated firmware
# from day one (ever since it's upstreamed), in which case this fix is either
# no-op (for 3A5000 systems), or incorrect (for systems with CPU models other
# than 3A5000). You can just uninstall this package without any harm.
#
# Removal on 2023-09-04.
