# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone with a format of YYYY-MM-DD, and an explanation of why
# something is getting masked.
# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can
# cause large-scale breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

#--- END OF EXAMPLES ---

# WANG Xuerui <xen0n@gentoo.org> (2024-01-18)
# No longer maintained, cannot keep up with the ever-raising psABI baseline.
# Please just use the latest lld in ::gentoo.
#
# Removal on 2024-02-01.
=sys-devel/lld-16.0.6-r2

# WANG Xuerui <xen0n@gentoo.org> (2024-01-12)
# No longer relevant: today's best practice is to just flash latest firmware
# from https://github.com/loongson/Firmware that provides real new-world
# interfaces, or simply do nothing as most boards from 2022 onwards have the
# "legacy boot mode" switch right in their stock firmware, that one simply
# ensures to be disbled.
#
# Removal on 2024-02-01.
